# week-fourteen-challenge-karenas - Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a CMS-style blog site, where developers can publish blog posts and comment on other's posts, too. It was designed using the Model View Controller model. 

## Functionallity

The user can access the blogsite at week-fourteen-challenge-karenas.onrender.com. While the user can see post previews on the homepage, the user needs to sign up for an account and login in order to create posts and leave comments. The user can also delete their own posts. When a user submits a Post Title, and Content, a post entry is posted to the blog's database, then they are available for view on individual post pages, which can be accessed for viewing from the users profile page, and the homepage. 

## Notes

I attended office hours, and received help from my Instructor, TA and Tutor in order to complete this project. 
The blogsite is deployed [here.](https://week-fourteen-challenge-karenas.onrender.com)
